## 10/18/2025 - Testing setups  

![IMG_3700.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzEyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--40b9b906afaafd063e25c7864aab2f3568703bc0/IMG_3700.jpeg)

I'm trying to build this out of existent parts only. I dug the old revision out of the box today. There are a few major requirements.
I know some parts I'm gonna need off the top of my head:
- 8x 3.7v LiPo batteries
- 8x 3.6v Relays
- 8x XAIO ESP32C3 Microcontrollers
- A lot of hot glue
I'll post back here once I've done more.
  

## 10/19/2025 9 AM - Deconstruction of old model  

These dang solenoids barely exist, there's one listing on Digiday that seems reliable and then a bunch of Amazon junk. 
Needed to take this apart as old version had servos burning out.
Anyway, I dismantled my previous revision of this project, stabbed myself twice in the process. **Note to self:** Don't use too much hot glue.

## 10/19/2025 11 AM - Inital parts list created  

![Screenshot 2025-10-19 at 11.45.30‚ÄØAM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQwMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4f02ad164e93bc83604f19e535200c8cce45efee/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20at%2011.45.30%E2%80%AFAM.png)

After much deliberation, I created an initial parts list. Unfortunately, this parts list is much too long/expensive to do anything with. I'll continue to optimize it down. If you have any recommendations please contact at femurdev@gmail.com. Please & Thank you!  

## 10/19/2025 1 PM - Inner Bell Clip  

![Screenshot 2025-10-19 at 12.25.33‚ÄØPM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--13c95a8272327b2cf21b01e1506be6c8d58c5918/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20at%2012.25.33%E2%80%AFPM.png)

I measured and designed the inner bell clip, yet to fabricate, but I think it's looking good so far. Dependent on the bells you use, this may be different. My bells have a flat sop at the top that many others may not have. There's a bit of string required at the top too. This is like version 4 at this point, which is why it took an hour.
  

## 10/19/2025 10:43 PM - Rest of Build Design  

I got the rest of this model together (3d at least) but have yet to model out the interactions of the boards with each other / the website. I have a previous test that proves that this works, but unfortunately, I dismantled it and is part of a research project that I can't show without getting in trouble.
Anyway, here's the full thing:

## 10/19/2025 10:56 PM - Software Architechture Design  

![Untitled drawing.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYzNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f7d9391f996f76d846205bf10d7ed486968c2fdd/Untitled%20drawing.png)
Here's the rest of this project's outline. I'll be able to send more about this project once I get it approved. I hope this conveys the level of complexity within this project, as offsets must be accounted for and timings must be precise for the music to sound correct. Furthermore, I already bought the bells, which were 60 bucks alone. I intend to hook this up to a song machine with AI or MIDI input on a website which I will develop once this project is approved.  

## 10/23/2025 5 PM - Circuitboard CAD Assembly  

![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 5.56.00‚ÄØPM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDkxNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--68552654a426beb5bba0e79d80e7ab3937eff685/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%205.56.00%E2%80%AFPM.png)

I designed a full assembly view for the bells now. I don't know how to do wires yet, so let me know if that level of an assembly view is required. Likewise, I learned why assemblies were important, because I almost ordered 2x the JH connectors. (MB) Definitely something I'll carry with me.
Secondly, I changed a major component (the 5v regulator) for a cheaper version. Hoping for some funding for this project, as I'm really getting excited about this now. I'll be back with a code + Full CAD update later.

P.S. Don't laugh, I had to teach myself Onshape Assembly studios to do this correctly! It was haphazardly placing parts in kind of the right place before.
  

## 10/23/2025 6 PM - Full CAD Complete  

![Screenshot 2025-10-23 at 6.16.26‚ÄØPM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDkyMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8f9cc0f11899853b41507cd46dc5b0b995130e19/Screenshot%202025-10-23%20at%206.16.26%E2%80%AFPM.png)
I made my full cad model. I'm putting it up on GitHub for now, but I may rework it at some point later down the road to be in a handle shape. For now, here it is. I swear this process went 100x quicker because I knew what I was doing. It's fun now so I'll keep doing it.  

## 10/24/2025 6 AM - Tried Bluetooth  

![Screenshot 2025-10-24 at 6.45.59‚ÄØAM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTA2NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f727137fdb6b1e140a096a2885f5853dcddb547e/Screenshot%202025-10-24%20at%206.45.59%E2%80%AFAM.png)
I tried to code this in Bluetooth, but everything kept on breaking. I'm thinking that I'll use Wi-Fi now due to the low latency. Not only that, but I did come up with a cool way to program the notes for now. That's really it, this one was a fail. More when I get my homework done.


  

## 10/24/2025 3 PM - Wi-Fi connections  

Sorry that the pictures are straight code here, that's really the most exciting thing. The only other thing is two ESP32s. Wifi seems to work like a charm, though, so I'm going to keep using it. I can basically verify it. uploads and connects, but not much more without the components. (üôè for grant)

_There's gonna be so much soldering. (to save money ofc)_

## 10/29/2025 - Learning Kicad  

I'm making a PCB for this project to help decrease costs. I have to say, it's like pipes/snake but still extremely challenging. I'm looking forward to producing it even though it is completely new to me.
I watched like 4 tutorials on KiCad and put together a battery-powered light for now. This is confusing at first
