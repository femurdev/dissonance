## 10/18/2025 - Testing setups  

![IMG_3700.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzEyMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--40b9b906afaafd063e25c7864aab2f3568703bc0/IMG_3700.jpeg)

I'm trying to build this out of existent parts only. I dug the old revision out of the box today. There are a few major requirements.
I know some parts I'm gonna need off the top of my head:
- 8x 3.7v LiPo batteries
- 8x 3.6v Relays
- 8x XAIO ESP32C3 Microcontrollers
- A lot of hot glue
I'll post back here once I've done more.
  

## 10/19/2025 9 AM - Deconstruction of old model  

These dang solenoids barely exist, there's one listing on Digiday that seems reliable and then a bunch of Amazon junk. 
Needed to take this apart as old version had servos burning out.
Anyway, I dismantled my previous revision of this project, stabbed myself twice in the process. **Note to self:** Don't use too much hot glue.

## 10/19/2025 11 AM - Inital parts list created  

![Screenshot 2025-10-19 at 11.45.30 AM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQwMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4f02ad164e93bc83604f19e535200c8cce45efee/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20at%2011.45.30%E2%80%AFAM.png)

After much deliberation, I created an initial parts list. Unfortunately, this parts list is much too long/expensive to do anything with. I'll continue to optimize it down. If you have any recommendations please contact at femurdev@gmail.com. Please & Thank you!  

## 10/19/2025 1 PM - Inner Bell Clip  

![Screenshot 2025-10-19 at 12.25.33 PM.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzQwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--13c95a8272327b2cf21b01e1506be6c8d58c5918/Screenshot%202025-10-19%20at%2012.25.33%E2%80%AFPM.png)

I measured and designed the inner bell clip, yet to fabricate, but I think it's looking good so far. Dependent on the bells you use, this may be different. My bells have a flat sop at the top that many others may not have. There's a bit of string required at the top too.
  

## 10/19/2025 10:43 PM - Rest of Build Design  

I got the rest of this model together (3d at least) but have yet to model out the interactions of the boards with each other / the website. I have a previous test that proves that this works, but unfortunately, I dismantled it and is part of a research project that I can't show without getting in trouble.
Anyway, here's the full thing:

## 10/19/2025 10:56 PM - Software Architechture Design  

![Untitled drawing.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYzNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f7d9391f996f76d846205bf10d7ed486968c2fdd/Untitled%20drawing.png)
Here's the rest of this project's outline. I'll be able to send more about this project once I get it approved. I hope this conveys the level of complexity within this project, as offsets must be accounted for and timings must be precise for the music to sound correct. Furthermore, I already bought the bells, which were 60 bucks alone. I intend to hook this up to a song machine with AI or MIDI input on a website which I will develop once this project is approved.
